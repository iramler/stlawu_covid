# stlawu_covid
Contains the daily covid-19 cases (active and total) data for townships in St. Lawrence county.

The slc_vaccine.csv file contains the number of vaccine doses received and administered by the entire North Country region. The percent SLC population is just an estimate of the percent of population in SLC relative to the total region. It will not change over the dates. (For analyses, we will simply need to assume a number of doses are given to each county proportional to their population. i.e., SLC receives 26% of the total number of doses.)
